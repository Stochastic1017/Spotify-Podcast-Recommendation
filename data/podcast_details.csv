Bella also shares her own anecdotes and the conversations expand into deeper discussions on life’s universal themes—love, identity, culture, anxiousness, and even politics.Through a series of tailored questions, Bella creates a relaxed, intimate atmosphere where her guests—ranging from fashion icons to cultural figures in sport, art, music and literature reveal more about themselves than they might expect. Fashion is often dismissed as superficial, but in this podcast, it becomes the lens through which we examine our inner lives, relationships, and society.From Kate Moss to other notable guests, Fashion Neurosis with Bella Freud offers a unique, thoughtful, and engaging conversation that goes far beyond what we wear: diving into the unspoken language of clothing and the ways in which we use style to navigate and communicate in the world.www.fashionneurosis.com@fashionnueorsis_bellafreud","<p>Each week join the renowned fashion designer Bella Freud as she invites a special guest to ‘lie on the couch’ and explore the connection between fashion and identity.

The Emerald,1OwFblqZ7FIkLSW4rvbJEF,"The Emerald explores the human experience through a vibrant lens of myth, story, and imagination. Brought to life through the wise, wild, and humorous vision of Joshua Michael Schrei — a teacher and lifelong student of the cosmologies and mythologies of the world — the podcast draws from a deep well of poetry, lore, and mythos to challenge conventional narratives on politics and public discourse, meditation and mindfulness, art, science, literature, and more. At the heart of the podcast is the premise that the imaginative, poetic, animate heart of human experience — elucidated by so many cultures over so many thousands of years — is missing in modern discourse and is urgently needed at a time when humanity is facing unprecedented problems. The Emerald advocates for an imaginative vision of human life and human discourse as it questions deep underlying assumptions about societal progress.","The Emerald explores the human experience through a vibrant lens of myth, story, and imagination.

The podcast is taken directly from the YouTube channel of the same name and is always open to suggestions for new stories and submissions from you. <a href=""mailto:mrcreepypasta&#64;gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mrcreepypasta&#64;gmail.com</a><br /><br />Support the podcast here: <a href=""https://patreon.com/mrcreepypasta"" rel=""nofollow"">https://patreon.com/mrcreepypasta</a><br /><br />Become a supporter of this podcast: <a href=""https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/mrcreepypasta-s-storytime--4244348/support?utm_source&#61;rss&amp;utm_medium&#61;rss&amp;utm_campaign&#61;rss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/mrcreepypasta-s-storytime--4244348/support</a>.",MrCreepyPasta,['en'],audio,1000,"AD,AE,AG,AL,AM,AO,AR,AT,AU,AZ,BA,BB,BE,BF,BG,BH,BI,BJ,BN,BO,BR,BS,BT,BW,BZ,CA,CH,CI,CL,CM,CO,CR,CV,CW,CY,CZ,DE,DJ,DK,DM,DO,DZ,EC,EE,EG,ES,FI,FJ,FM,FR,GA,GB,GD,GE,GH,GM,GN,GQ,GR,GT,GW,GY,HK,HN,HR,HT,HU,ID,IE,IL,IN,IS,IT,JM,JO,JP,KE,KH,KI,KM,KN,KR,KW,LA,LB,LC,LI,LR,LS,LT,LU,LV,MA,MC,ME,MG,MH,MK,ML,MN,MO,MR,MT,MU,MV,MW,MX,MY,MZ,NA,NE,NG,NI,NL,NO,NP,NR,NZ,OM,PA,PE,PG,PH,PL,PR,PS,PT,PW,PY,QA,RO,RS,RW,SA,SB,SC,SE,SG,SI,SK,SL,SM,SN,SR,ST,SV,SZ,TD,TG,TH,TL,TN,TO,TR,TT,TV,TW,TZ,UA,US,UY,UZ,VC,VN,VU,WS,XK,ZA,ZM,ZW",False,True,https://open.spotify.com/show/0smDmHOI9OND09y8cVoq2U,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8ac8b09e56822874b22c7d88f9,spotify:show:0smDmHOI9OND09y8cVoq2U,https://api.spotify.com/v1/shows/0smDmHOI9OND09y8cVoq2U,Arts,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67656300005f1fc8b09e56822874b22c7d88f9

As The Raven Dreams Podcast,1EFYMKPBTTkmKyDla2JE1Q,"The As The Raven Dreams podcast is a show where we explore the darker parts of human existence through true and harrowing stories. From sinister encounters with strangers, paranormal encounters that defy explanation, unsettling mysteries that linger in the shadows- and the always bizarre glitch in the matrix stories. So I implore you turn down the lights, tune in, and let the haunting tales of everyday people take you down that dark and creepy road. Remember, these aren't just stories... these are true experiences that remind us that our world can truly be terrifying. Sleep Well.   Note: None of the audio on this podcast is created through AI, it is 100% my voice. I am a team of 1 person, so mistakes do happen sometimes. Also, these stories are from everyday people (listeners, reddit and Forums), as such, they may sound like they are written by everyday people and not paid authors- because they are.","<p>The As The Raven Dreams podcast is a show where we explore the darker parts of human existence through true and harrowing stories.

10% Happier with Dan Harris,1CfW319UkBMVhCXfei8huv,"Dan Harris is a fidgety, skeptical journalist who had a panic attack on live national television, which led him to try something he otherwise never would have considered: meditation. He went on to write the bestselling book, 10% Happier. On this show, Dan talks with eminent meditation teachers, top scientists, and even the odd celebrity. Guests include everyone from His Holiness the Dalai Lama to Brené Brown to Karamo from Queer Eye. On some episodes, Dan ventures into the deep end of the pool, covering subjects such as enlightenment and psychedelics. On other episodes, it’s science-based techniques for issues such as anxiety, productivity, and relationships. Dan's approach is seemingly modest, but secretly radical: happiness is a skill you can train, just like working your bicep in the gym. Your progress may be incremental at first, but like any good investment, it compounds over time.New episodes come out every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Tony Mantor: Why Not Me the World,4dTv4Yxxf0WoM0fgBhv8XQ,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Although autism is becoming more widely recognized, there is still a lack of understanding and awareness surrounding the condition. As a result, many individuals and families affected by autism struggle to find the support and resources they need. Why Not Me The World podcast aims to bridge that gap by providing valuable information and insights into autism, fostering empathy and understanding, and promoting acceptance and inclusion. Nashville based Music Producer Tony Mantor explores the remarkable impact his guests make by empowering their voices in spreading awareness about autism and helping break down the barriers of understanding. Join Mantor and his guests as they delve into the world of autism and explore topics such as diagnosis, treatment, research, and personal stories. Together, we can create a more informed and compassionate society for individuals with autism. ","<p>Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects millions of people worldwide. <br />It is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. <br />Although autism is becoming more widely recognized, there is still a lack of understanding and awareness surrounding the condition. <br />As a result, many individuals and families affected by autism struggle to find the support and resources they need. <br />Why Not Me The World podcast aims to bridge that gap by providing valuable information and insights into autism, fostering empathy and understanding, and promoting acceptance and inclusion. <br />Nashville based Music Producer Tony Mantor explores the remarkable impact his guests make by empowering their voices in spreading awareness about autism and helping break down the barriers of understanding. <br />Join Mantor and his guests as they delve into the world of autism and explore topics such as diagnosis, treatment, research, and personal stories. <br />Together, we can create a more informed and compassionate society for individuals with autism.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> </p>",Tony Mantor,['en-US'],audio,67,"AD,AE,AG,AL,AM,AO,AR,AT,AU,AZ,BA,BB,BE,BF,BG,BH,BI,BJ,BN,BO,BR,BS,BT,BW,BZ,CA,CH,CI,CL,CM,CO,CR,CV,CW,CY,CZ,DE,DJ,DK,DM,DO,DZ,EC,EE,EG,ES,FI,FJ,FM,FR,GA,GB,GD,GE,GH,GM,GN,GQ,GR,GT,GW,GY,HK,HN,HR,HT,HU,ID,IE,IL,IN,IS,IT,JM,JO,JP,KE,KH,KI,KM,KN,KR,KW,LA,LB,LC,LI,LR,LS,LT,LU,LV,MA,MC,ME,MG,MH,MK,ML,MN,MO,MR,MT,MU,MV,MW,MX,MY,MZ,NA,NE,NG,NI,NL,NO,NP,NR,NZ,OM,PA,PE,PG,PH,PL,PR,PS,PT,PW,PY,QA,RO,RS,RW,SA,SB,SC,SE,SG,SI,SK,SL,SM,SN,SR,ST,SV,SZ,TD,TG,TH,TL,TN,TO,TR,TT,TV,TW,TZ,UA,US,UY,UZ,VC,VN,VU,WS,XK,ZA,ZM,ZW",False,False,https://open.spotify.com/show/4dTv4Yxxf0WoM0fgBhv8XQ,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8ad84e04ab73e8aa0d586e348f,spotify:show:4dTv4Yxxf0WoM0fgBhv8XQ,https://api.spotify.com/v1/shows/4dTv4Yxxf0WoM0fgBhv8XQ,Health & Fitness,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67656300005f1fd84e04ab73e8aa0d586e348f

My Victorian Nightmare,15h4sm3w9DtWRcywgFlzOU,"Here you’ll find mysterious deaths, morbid fascinations, disturbing stories, and otherwise spooky events from the Victorian Era. If you consider yourself an enthusiast of creepy Victorian history, you probably already know about the age of spiritualism, the grizzly murders, the grave robbers, twisted pseudo psychotherapy, and memento mori – But I try to dig a little deeper. This was a time full of lace corsetry, romantic poetry, and a deep reverence and affection for the dead. It was a culture of shared sorrow, ornament and elegance, prudishness and scandal, bone chilling children’s stories, and for whatever reason, I just feel at home there. There’s something strangely comforting about the heebie jeebies this era gives me. If you find yourself equally enchanted by things that most people would find horrifying, this podcast is probably for you.

Master Plan,53PK9UJVE1keigtCX5BkRZ,"A secret plot. A public theft. A democracy corrupted.  Discover the truth on Master Plan, winner of the 2024 Signal Awards for News & Politics and Best Writing. Hosted by David Sirota, former speechwriter for Bernie Sanders and Oscar-nominated co-writer of Don’t Look Up, Master Plan uncovers a deliberate scheme to legalize corruption in the U.S., enabling the wealthy to buy policies that serve them at the public’s expense.  How did our democracy become a kleptocracy? The Lever has unearthed never-before-reported documents revealing this 50-year plot as a coordinated effort by wealthy individuals and political ideologues. Across 11 episodes, the series traces this historic thread from the Watergate scandal in the ’70s to the Citizens United decision, current Supreme Court outrages, and the 2024 election. It’s a story of infamous figures like President Richard Nixon, Senator Mitch McConnell, and Fox News founder Roger Ailes—plus operatives and oligarchs you’ve never heard of.  www.masterplanpodcast.com","A secret plot.

And stay tuned for a look inside the episode each week on Quests N’ Answers, our exclusive Goblin Mode after show!

American Railroad,5qn1n7LvaLet6AGbWvaEc5,"Embark on ""American Railroad,"" a five-episode podcast that seeks to highlight the untold stories and unheard voices from the diverse communities that built America’s railway systems. Hosted by Grammy Award-winning musician and Silkroad Artistic Director Rhiannon Giddens, American Railroad is produced in partnership with PRX.  Silkroad, founded by Yo-Yo Ma in 1998, was inspired by the historical Silk Road and created as a model for cultural collaboration through music. In 2020, Rhiannon Giddens was named Artistic Director and immediately embarked on a mission to unearth the forgotten stories of America. Silkroad’s American Railroad project—years in the making—embodies Giddens’s vision for the Ensemble by shedding light on those erased or overlooked in American history while showcasing Silkroad's unique ability to amplify diverse voices. The project has since evolved into cross-country tours and performances, recording releases, educational materials, and this podcast series.  After the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, a trip from coast to coast that used to take months was shortened to just under a week, allowing for the transport of goods and ideas across the continent in ways previously inconceivable. Profit-seeking corporations and the American government financed it, but the people who actually built and were most affected by it are the focus — Indigenous and African Americans as well Irish, Chinese, Japanese, and other immigrant laborers whose contributions have been largely erased from history. Silkroad’s American Railroad seeks to paint a more accurate picture of the global diasporic origin of the American Empire. Each episode weaves music, storytelling, and historical analysis, traveling to railroad communities across the U.S. From the Chinese and Japanese laborers' crucial role in California's railroads, to the tragic tale of Black convict laborers in North Carolina, and the intersection of music and labor history in New York and Boston, the series brings to light the stories that have long been marginalized. The journey also takes us to the Standing Rock Reservation, showcasing the resilience and musical traditions of the Lakota community. Through intimate interviews with local culture bearers, historians, and Silkroad’s musicians, ""American Railroad"" paints a more accurate and inclusive picture of America's history.Join us weekly on Thursdays as we amplify the voices of those who have long been silenced, celebrate the diversity that built America, and uncover the enduring impact of these buried histories on our society today.","<p>Embark on &#34;American Railroad,&#34; a five-episode podcast that seeks to highlight the untold stories and unheard voices from the diverse communities that built America’s railway systems.

Dem Vinyl Boyz,0nOjEXuDGw2f8K5p8D35et,"For decades, people who enjoyed music on vinyl records instead of CDs or MP3s were considered dinosaurs. While we like moving at 33 RPM, the rest of the world rushed and went to digital. Not only did vinyl refuse to die but demand is at its highest since at least 1991. It's a good thing Dem Vinyl Boyz saved all their records from back in the day. Because, now we have the biggest collection of 12-inch records on the radio.  Dem Vinyl Boyz love the joy of sliding a classic album out of its cover; the crackle of a needle just dropped into a groove; the careful way to pick up and flip a record when a side ends. On the podcast each week we feature a different piece of music history on vinyl record. Dem Vinyl Boyz experience the album front and back, giving you commentary and music facts along the way. Put your ear buds in and let us take you on a musically journey listening to the greatest music of all time and the history of how it became legendary. Dem Vinyl Boyz!

The Telepathy Tapes,1zigaPaUWO4G9SiFV0Kf1c,"In a world that often dismisses the extraordinary as mere fantasy, The Telepathy Tapes dares to explore the profound abilities of non-speakers with autism—individuals who have long been misunderstood and underestimated. These silent communicators possess gifts that defy conventional understanding, from telepathy to otherworldly perceptions, challenging the limits of what we believe to be real.  For years, their parents and teachers have quietly witnessed these remarkable abilities, knowing that the time to share their truth would eventually come. But now, as the evidence mounts, the time has come to reveal what has been hidden in plain sight. This groundbreaking series challenges everything we think we know about communication and the human mind, inviting viewers to step into a reality where the impossible is not only possible but happening every day. Through emotional stories and undeniable evidence, The Telepathy Tapes offers a fresh perspective on the profound connections that exist beyond words. Traveling with Neuroscientist Dr. Diane Hennacy Powell, witnessing mind-boggling telepathy tests and forging deeply intimate relationships with families around the globe - Host Ky Dickens invites you to contemplate the world through the eyes of those who speak without words. Prepare to be captivated, challenged, and ultimately transformed as the series shines a light on the untold capabilities of those who have been underestimated for far too long.  Hosted on Acast.

12 Hour Sound Machines for Sleep (no loops or fades),7rb8eiXKJpg8gjmiY4yDAN,"The #1 Sound Machine Podcast in the world, downloaded over 225 million times 😴 Brought to you by Dwellspring. Download the Dwellspring App! Apple App Store | Google Play Store 🗣️ Follow Us on Instagram & TikTok @dwellspring.io --- Insomniacs...parents...travelers...noisy neighbor sufferers...rejoice! 12 hours of uninterrupted Sound Machines to help achieve deep & restful sleep, soothe a baby, mask unwanted noise, or calm your anxiety. All episodes are available for free in their entirety whether you are a premium subscriber or not. All 12 hours are offered with zero interruptions once the episode gets started. If these Sound Machines have been helpful for you, I'd be so grateful if you'd rate the show on either Spotify or Apple Podcasts 🙏 If you’d like to remove the intro & ad at the beginning, you can subscribe to the Podcast at dwellspring.io/podcast. --- My most popular Sound Machines are Brown Noise, Pink Noise, and White Noise. People use the Sound Machines for all sorts of applications but I hear most frequently from people using them to help them fall and stay asleep at home or when they travel, to help them get their baby to sleep and stay sleeping through the night, to help quiet their tinnitus, to mask unwanted noises while sleeping, traveling or studying, and to help calm their anxiety or ADHD. I have also heard from many parents who use it as ambient noise for their children on the Autism spectrum to help mask other anxiety-inducing or stressful sounds. I hope that, however you use them, my Sound Machines are helpful for you and your loved ones as you sleep, meditate, study, or otherwise tune out the world. 😴🧘👨‍🎓 --- Keywords: Sleep | Insomnia | Brown Noise | White Noise | Pink Noise | Baby | Ambient Noise | Sound Machine | Sound Masking | Noise Masking | Insomnia | Relax | Relaxing | Study | Focus | Concentrate | Concentration | Water | Rain | Thunder | Ocean | Ocean Waves | Stress | Soothing | Colic | Dr. Harvey Karp | 3 S's | Shh | Shhh | Pregnancy | Pregnant | Tinnitus | Travel | Meditate | Meditation | Dohm | Marpac | Panic Attack | ADHD | Anxiety | Peaceful | Mindful | Mindfulness | 8 hours | 10 hours | 12 hours","<p>The #1 Sound Machine Podcast in the world, downloaded over 225 million times &#x1f634;</p><p>Brought to you by <a href=""https://dwellspring.io"" rel=""nofollow"">Dwellspring</a>.

Sword and Scale,2dzMey4yRYKX5NWKp8zPrd,"Sword and Scale is a true crime podcast covering the dark underworld of crime and the criminal justice system’s response to it. The first episode launched January 1st, 2014 and feature stories of murder, abduction, rape, and even more bizarre forms of crime.

Everything from 911 calls to court testimony, interviews with victims and sometimes with perpetrators give listeners a 360 degree look at the seedy underbelly of human nature and so-called civilized society. Told from an everyman's point of view, Sword and Scale goes beyond the news clips and the sensationalist headlines to hold up a mirror to the audience and ask, ""Is it us versus them? Or are we just like 'them' too?"" Sword and scale proves that the worst monsters are real.","Sword and Scale is a true crime podcast covering the dark underworld of crime and the criminal justice system’s response to it. The first episode launched January 1st, 2014 and feature stories of murder, abduction, rape, and even more bizarre forms of crime. It’s the purest form of true-crime where the raw uncensored audio tells the story. Everything from 911 calls to court testimony, interviews with victims and sometimes with perpetrators give listeners a 360 degree look at the seedy underbelly of human nature and so-called civilized society. Told from an everyman&#39;s point of view, Sword and Scale goes beyond the news clips and the sensationalist headlines to hold up a mirror to the audience and ask, &#34;Is it us versus them?

Over 14 gripping episodes, we meticulously reconstruct the events leading up to Ada's disappearance, exploring the initial efforts to find her and the myriad of suspects and theories that emerged in the wake of her vanishing.  The investigation takes a dramatic turn when Ada's remains are discovered three years later in a wooded area 12 miles from her home, transforming a missing persons case into a homicide investigation. As law enforcement scrambles to make sense of new evidence, the focus shifts to surprising potential suspects, including Ada's neighbor.  Through exclusive interviews with family members, law enforcement, and key witnesses, ""The Deck Investigates"" grapples with questions about the challenges of pursuing justice decades after a crime.
